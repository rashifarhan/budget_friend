# personal_money_manager
Personal Money Manager is a Flutter project that helps individuals manage their finances effectively. This app leverages the power of Hive database, a fast and efficient NoSQL database that allows for easy storage and retrieval of financial information. With Personal Money Manager, users can keep track of their income, expenses, and budgets, all in one place.
Some of the features of the app include:

1)Income and Expense Tracking: Users can input their income and expenses and categorize them for better tracking and analysis.

2)Budget Management: The app provides an easy way to set and track budgets for various categories of expenses, such as food, entertainment, and housing.

3)Reports: Personal Money Manager generates reports that provide insights into the user's financial situation. This helps users make informed decisions about their finances.

4)Secure Data Storage: With Hive database, the app ensures that users' financial information is safe and secure. The data is encrypted and stored on the device, so users can access it at any time.

5)Customizable Categories: Users can create their own categories for income and expenses, making it easy to track their financial information in a way that makes sense to them.
